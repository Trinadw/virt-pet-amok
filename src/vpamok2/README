#Virtual Pet Amok
This app allows the user to care for pets in a shelter. There are organic and robotic cats and dogs. Each pet has a name, description, type and species.
The app begins by welcoming the user to the shelter.
The user is able to select from a menu what they would like to do. 
Based on the user selection the shelter pets hunger, thirst, happiness and waste levels are adjusted. There are also the options to play with, adopt and accept new pets.
If the user chooses to adopt a pet they are prompted to enter the pets name and the pet is removed from the shelter roster.
If the user chooses to admit a pet, they are prompted to enter the pets name, description, type and species. This information is added to the pet roster.
When the user is finished they can select Quit to exit the app.

The creation of the app begins with inputting the details of the animals in the shelter.
The animals are added to the shelter roster so that there are pets available for the user to interact with.
A while statement is used to start the interaction with the user. Prompting them to select an action to take.
The switch/case provides the options available and the methods used as a result of the users selection.
A tick is added to the end of each interval of the game to adjust the pets care levels.
